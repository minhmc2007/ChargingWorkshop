        Currently, audio supports playback in five states:\n
        They are:\n
        1. Low Battery: 0-20% battery\n
        2. Medium Battery: 21-70% battery\n
        3. High Battery: 71-99% battery\n
        4. Fully Charged: 100% (audio will keep playing when fully charged, but probably no one wants to keep it plugged in after it\'s full, right?)\n
        5. Unplugged\n
        Other tips:\n
        1. Clicking on an audio file will open a menu where you can add flags for different states to play the audio in those states.\n
        2. An audio file can have multiple flags, and if there are multiple audios for a state, one will be randomly selected to play.\n
        3. If a flag is already set, setting it again will remove that flag.\n

        The permissions that need to be manually granted may be represented differently on various systems. If you find that the app cannot display outside the app or on the lock screen during operation, it is likely due to special permission restrictions on the system. You will need to find and grant the corresponding permissions yourself.
