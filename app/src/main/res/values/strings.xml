        Currently, audio can be played in five stages of charging.\n
        Those stages are:\n
        1. Low Battery: 0-20%\n
        2. Medium Battery: 21-70%\n
        3. High Battery: 71-99%\n
        4. Full: 100% (Voice will be played continuously after fully charged. No one would want to keep it plugged in after it is fully charged, right?)\n
        5. Unplug\n
        \n
        Other tips:\n
        1. Click on the audio to open the corresponding menu. Adding different state Flags will allow it to play in different states.\n
        2. An audio can support multiple Flags. If there are multiple audios in one state, one will be randomly selected for playback.\n
        3. If the same Flag is set again while it is already applied to the audio, the Flag will be cleared.\n

        The permissions that need to be granted vary across different systems. If the application is not displayed on the non-application or lock screen during operation, it is likely due to special permission restrictions on the system. You will need to locate and grant the necessary permissions manually.
